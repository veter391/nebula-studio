# 🌌 Nebula Studio

**A production-grade, browser-based beat maker and step sequencer built entirely on the Web Audio API.**

Zero dependencies. Zero build step. The audio engine and every UI feature run entirely client-side — the only server-side piece is a small, optional proxy that lets the AI Assistant work out of the box without you needing an API key (see [AI Assistant](#-ai-assistant) below); everything else is pure static files you can open from disk or deploy anywhere.

## ✨ Features

### 🎚️ Production audio engine
- **12 unique voices** synthesized from scratch — kick, snare, hi-hat, clap, tom, rim, bass (saw + sub), lead (square + vibrato), pad (LFO-filtered chord), pluck, fx-sweep, sub-bass
- **Per-track FX chain** — every track gets its own filter + 3-band EQ + saturation + compressor
- **Master FX** — convolution reverb (procedurally generated impulse), feedback delay, soft-clip limiter
- **Lookahead scheduler** with sample-accurate timing (25 ms tick, 120 ms horizon)
- **Variable swing** (0–60 %)
- Runs entirely on the main thread today (no AudioWorklet yet — a real migration target, not shipped)

### 🎼 Composition
- **16-step sequencer** with 12 tracks
- **Song mode** with 4 pattern slots (A / B / C / D) chained in any order
- **Pattern save / load** with named slots in `localStorage` (10 slots, persists across sessions)
- **Procedural generator (🎲 ROLL)** — deterministic, genre-aware beat generation from a seed. Purely algorithmic, no network call.
- **AI Assistant (✨)** — describe a vibe in your own words; a real LLM call (OpenRouter, works out of the box via a shared free-tier proxy, or bring your own key) picks the genre and seed, then the *same* deterministic generator above builds the actual pattern. See [AI Assistant](#-ai-assistant).
- **Virtual MIDI keyboard** — sustained notes (press-and-hold), full 2-octave computer-key mapping, gated behind an explicit "Keyboard Mode" so it never hijacks other shortcuts
- **Play Along** (Learn tab) — practice mode with a scrolling note timeline and real-time hit detection
- **Chord pad** — one-click chord progressions

### 🎨 Visuals
- **4 visualizer modes** — spectrum, oscilloscope, particle field, nebula clouds
- **Audio-reactive particles** that burst on every hit
- **4 themes** — Cosmic (default), Light, Sunset, Matrix
- **Glassmorphism + aurora background** with smooth animations
- **Fully responsive** — works from 360 px phone to 4K display

### 📚 Learn
- **Built-in tutorial system** with progressive lessons
- **Progress saved per lesson** in `localStorage`
- **Interactive**: highlights relevant UI elements and guides you through real edits

### 💾 Export
- **WAV export** — offline-rendered 16-bit PCM via `OfflineAudioContext` (up to 8 bars)
- **MIDI export** — standard `.mid` files that open in Ableton, FL Studio, Logic, etc.
- **Live recording** — captures the actual output to `.webm`
- **Project share** — encode/decode full session as URL hash for sharing

### ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts
- `Space` — play / pause
- `C` — clear pattern
- `R` — record
- `E` — export WAV
- `M` — export MIDI
- `Ctrl/Cmd+Z` (`+Shift` for redo) — undo / redo

These are suspended automatically while **Keyboard Mode** is on (Keyboard tab), since at that point the letter keys are playing notes instead:
- `Z X C V B N M` / `S D G H J` — lower octave, white / black keys
- `Q W E R T Y U` / `2 3 5 6 7` — upper octave, white / black keys
- `Escape` (or the on-screen button) — exit Keyboard Mode

## 🤖 AI Assistant

Describe a vibe ("dark warehouse rave at 3am") and a real LLM call maps it onto the app's genre vocabulary — the deterministic procedural generator (`ai.js`) then builds the actual pattern from that. The model **never** authors audio, note data, or steps; it only ever picks a value from a closed, validated set (see `AI-NOTES.md` for the full breakdown of this contract, plus its test coverage in `test/ai-assistant.test.js`).

**Two modes, your choice, in Settings (✨ button):**
- **Shared (default, no setup)** — routes through this deployment's own `/api/ai` Worker endpoint, which holds a shared OpenRouter key server-side (a Cloudflare secret, never shipped to the browser) and applies a fair-use rate limit.
- **Bring your own key** — paste an OpenRouter key, stored only in your browser's `localStorage`, calls OpenRouter directly (never touches this app's server), no shared rate limit, and lets you pick a specific model.

If the AI call fails for any reason (rate limit, timeout, a free model having a bad day), the UI automatically falls back to the same deterministic 🎲 roll — clearly labeled as a fallback, never silently pretending the AI call succeeded.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Option A — open the file
```bash
git clone https://github.com/veter391/nebula-studio.git
cd nebula-studio
open index.html          # macOS
xdg-open index.html      # Linux
start index.html         # Windows
```
That's it. No `npm install`, no build. The audio engine, sequencer, and every non-AI feature work fine straight from disk. The AI Assistant's default (no-key) mode needs `/api/ai` to actually resolve, so from `file://` it'll fail over to "add your own key" — see [AI Assistant](#-ai-assistant).

> Modern browsers (Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Safari ≥ 14) require a user gesture before audio starts — the boot screen handles this.

### Option B — local dev server (recommended for hot reload)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8080`. (This serves the static files only — the `/api/ai` proxy isn't running locally this way; see below.)

### Option C — deploy
This repo ships as a **Cloudflare Worker with static assets** (`wrangler.toml` + `worker.js`) — the AI Assistant's shared/default mode (no key needed) only works when deployed this way, since `worker.js` is what hosts the `/api/ai` proxy and holds the shared OpenRouter key as a Cloudflare secret.

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_KEY   # your own shared key, once
npm run deploy                           # wrangler deploy
```

If you deploy `index.html` + `src/` + `public/` to a plain static host instead (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3) — that works too, but there's no `/api/ai` there, so the AI Assistant only works in **bring-your-own-key** mode (Settings → paste an OpenRouter key). Everything else (the entire audio engine, sequencer, export, Learn tab) is unaffected either way.

### State

A single `store.js` module exposes a tiny pub/sub state container. Every UI module subscribes to the slices it cares about (e.g. mixer subscribes to `tracks`, sequencer subscribes to `pattern`). State is persisted to `localStorage` on every change (debounced).

## 🧪 Browser support

| Browser | Status |
|---|---|
| Chrome / Edge ≥ 90 | ✅ full support |
| Firefox ≥ 88 | ✅ full support |
| Safari ≥ 14.5 | ✅ full support |
| Mobile Safari iOS 14+ | ✅ touch works everywhere; Keyboard Mode's computer-key input is desktop-only by nature (tapping the on-screen keys still works) |
| Chrome Android | ✅ same caveat as above |

Required Web APIs: `AudioContext`, `OfflineAudioContext`, `AnalyserNode`, `ConvolverNode`, `MediaRecorder`, `MediaStreamDestination`, `localStorage`, `ServiceWorker` (optional, for offline support), ES Modules.
